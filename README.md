# GianPDev's Knowledge Base of notes
*IMPORTANT: a lot in a lot of notes, I use **root** user, so I omit `sudo` on a lot of things, so `sudo` might be required even if not stated.*

This is updated almost daily, every time I `git push` to the repo, github calls a webhook to netlify and tells it to build the page! This is the power of CI/CD ðŸ˜Š!

The website was auto generated by [ppeetteerrs/obsidian-zola](https://github.com/ppeetteerrs/obsidian-zola)

Raw files can be found in [GianPDev/GianPDev_KnowledgeBase](https://github.com/GianPDev/GianPDev_KnowledgeBase)

Notes were made in obsidian and I recommend using Obsidian to view them (when cloned from github repo)!
