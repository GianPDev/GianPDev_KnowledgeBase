[[nmcli]]
[[ip (linux cli tool)]]

### Yabs Error:  "`Warning: Both IPv4 AND IPv6 connectivity were not detected. Check for DNS issues...`" Or if curl is not working on anything

Check `/etc/resolve.conf`
```bash
vi /etc/resolve.conf
```
Should look like this:
```bash
# Generated by NetworkManager
nameserver 1.1.1.1
nameserver 1.0.0.1
```

### Change Hostname
```bash
hostnamectl set-hostname NAME
```

### Proxmox Default Settings
`/etc/network/interfaces`
*when managing bare metal server, address, subnet mask and gateway should be in the provider's panel somewhere (hopefully), replace the ip numbers accordingly*
```bash
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

iface eno1 inet manual

auto vmbr0
iface vmbr0 inet static
	address 192.168.10.3
	netmask 255.255.255.0
	# OR to omit the netmask
	address 192.168.10.3/24
	# this ^^^, calculate the /24 part from the subnet mask
	gateway 192.168.10.1
	bridge_ports eno1
	bridge_stp off
	bridge_fd 0
```

### Almalinux networking
[[nmcli]] and `nmtui`

### Proxmox not connecting or pinging public IPs
if all else fails, there may be a ip conflict, which requires a restart of the datacenter node, as restarting the VM will not fix ip conflicts (from what I've known). I tested this by restarting the datacenter after trying to give a static IP which was given to a different VM, I then tried assigning a static IP that's never been used to a completely new VM and ping(ing) 1.1.1.1 yielded results.
